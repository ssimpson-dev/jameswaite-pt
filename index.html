        â€œI contacted James for help with my eating schedule because I was eating
        junk and feeling the effects of it. I don't go to the gym so I needed a
        diet that would work for me without the time to exercise. I lost 9lbs in
        three weeks. James was always checking in and offering advice along the
        way." <br /><span class="author">- William Hughes</span>

        "I reached out to James because I was eating poorly and didn't have the
        motivation or consistency to change what I was doing. James designed a
        personalised plan that I was able to stick to and I lost 7 lbs in three
        weeks. James had kept in touch, supported me and kept me
        accountable."<br /><span class="author">- Sharron McGill</span>

        "I reached my final workout and weight check-in today. Absolutely over
        the moon with the results over the past 12 weeks. I can't thank you
        enough for pointing me in the right direction."<br /><span
